1: Write a Python program merge two tuples and remove duplicates

2: Write a Python program convert a tuple of integers to a tuple of strings.

3: Write a Python program find the frequency of each element in a tuple.

4:  Write a Python program find the difference between two tuples.

5: Write a Python program find the second largest element in a tuple.

6:  Write a Python program check if a tuple is a subset of another tuple.

7: Write a Python program to Extract tuples having K digit elements.

K = 2

Original List :  [(47, 23), (3, 78), (22, 53), (121, 45), (7,)]

Extracted Tuples :  [(47, 23), (22, 53)]



8: Write a Python program to sort a list of tuples by the second Item.



Value: 

tup =[('for', 2), ('is', 9), ('to', 7),('Go', 5), ('or', 15), ('a', 13)]



Expected:

[('for', 2), ('Go', 5), ('to', 7), ('is', 9), ('a', 13), ('or', 15)]



9: Remove an element from a tuple.

10: Write a Python program to compute the element-wise sum of given tuples.

Original lists:

Input:

(1, 2, 3, 4)

(3, 5, 2, 1)

(2, 2, 3, 1)

Expected: Element-wise sum of the said tuples:

(6, 9, 8, 6)
